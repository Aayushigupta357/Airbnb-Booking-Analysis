# Project on Airbnb Booking Analysis

# Goal

The primary aim of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on 
Airbnb booking data to uncover patterns and trends that influence booking behaviors, 
pricing strategies, and user preferences. By analyzing this data, the project seeks to 
provide actionable insights for hosts, travelers, and stakeholders to optimize their 
strategies and decision-making processes.

INTRODUCTION :-

New York City is a bustling metropolis located in the northeastern region of the United States. It is often referred to as the "City That Never Sleeps" due to
its vibrant nightlife and round-the-clock activity. The city is home to a diverse population of over 8 million people, making it one of the most densely populated 
areas in the country.

New York City is known for its iconic landmarks, such as the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, and Central Park. It is also renowned for its world-class
museums, restaurants, and shopping destinations. From the bright lights of Times Square to the trendy neighborhoods of Brooklyn, New York City offers something for 
everyone.

Airbnb is a popular online platform that allows travelers to book unique accommodations directly from local hosts. In New York City, Airbnb offers a wide range 
of options, including apartments, lofts, and private rooms. Many of these listings are located in trendy neighborhoods, providing visitors with a local experience 
that is different from staying in a traditional hotel. However, it is important to note that New York City has strict laws regulating short-term rentals, and 
travelers should ensure that their Airbnb booking complies with local regulations.
